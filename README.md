## 🚀 What’s Inside?

This is a React + Vite website for ALBERTO WATCH.  
It’s got cool sections like:

- **Home** (Header)
- **Collections** (Luxury, Smart, Sports, Vintage Watches)
- **Technology** (Mechanical, Quartz, Smart)
- **Watch Details** (Specs, Ratings, Features)
- **Store Locator** (Find stores worldwide)
- **About Us** (Our story, values, stats)
- **Contact Us** (Get in touch!)

All sections are built as React components. Navigation is smooth and scroll-based (no page reloads).
